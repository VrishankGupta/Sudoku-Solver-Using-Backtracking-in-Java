# Sudoku-Solver-Using-Backtracking-in-Java
This Java program solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. It fills the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains the digits 1 to 9 exactly once. Starting with a partially filled grid, it tests each digit for validity, backtracking when conflicts arise, until the puzzle is solved or determined unsolvable.
