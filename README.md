# Sudoku-Solver-Using-Backtracking-in-Java
This Java program effectively tackles a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle by utilizing a sophisticated backtracking algorithm. The algorithm operates by systematically filling in the grid, ensuring that each number from 1 to 9 appears exactly once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid — a fundamental requirement of Sudoku.

The program begins with a partially filled grid that presents a blend of challenges and opportunities for finding a solution. It evaluates the validity of each potential number placement through a series of checks that confirm compliance with Sudoku rules. If the placement of a number leads to a conflict — where a number is repeated in a row, column, or subgrid — the program employs a backtracking technique. This involves retracing its steps to the last valid number placement, allowing the algorithm to explore alternative options.

The iterative process continues, with the program dynamically adjusting and testing different number placements until it either successfully solves the puzzle or determines that it is unsolvable. This method not only showcases the power of logical reasoning but also highlights the efficiency of algorithmic techniques in resolving complex combinatorial problems like Sudoku, ultimately demonstrating how structured problem-solving can lead to effective solutions.
